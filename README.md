# song.master
a very special project in a sense that it will not be of any interet to anybody than me.
# what does it do?
song.master is a java application that scans a folder for songs in mp3 format composed by me and 
1. compares the found songs to a list of songs within the application to ensure that they match
2. checks if the mp3 album cover art is up to date (cover art must exist)
3. checks if the mp3 metadate is up to date (compared to the data within the application)
4. generates a -wave.png file visualizing the wave form of the song
5. generates a mp4 video using the album cover art and the mp3 metadata
